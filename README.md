# ResoniteChatBox

This is a Work in Progress mod for Resonite that is an australian translator and an alternative mute helper. This is to solve the delay for messages when desynced by using valueStreams to send the text, Doing this makes the messages continue to work like how voices and body tracking are still correct whilst everything else is desynced.

## Work in progress
it seems strings canot be sent as value stream instead but instead I must use many chars this is making things slightly more complicated
